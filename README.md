# NationalGalleryPlanner

This Java project creates paths to navigate through the second floor of the National Gallery in London based on user inputs. The rooms are processed as a graph-node structure, and utilises graph-processing algorithms such as Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

This was Assignment 2 of Data Structures and Algorithms 2.
